# This script merges all files from a given sample (the sample id(sid) is
# provided in the third argument ($3)) into a single file, which should be
# stored in the output directory specified by the second argument ($2).
#
# The directory containing the samples is indicated by the first argument ($1).

# Capture input parameters from command arguments

# Create output directory in case it doesnÂ´t exist
mkdir -p out/merged

# Merge the fastqs from the same sample into a single file
